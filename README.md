# Banana-Black-sigatoka-disease-detection-using-deep-learning
This project is developed using CNN on the dataset of black sigatoka disease which is most common and devasting disease in banana plant.

The dataset contain images of banana plant divided into 4 parts i.e healthy folder contains images of healthy banana plant leaf(leaves), initial folder contains images of banana plant leaf(leaves) which have black sigatoka disease but in small amount and pattern like tiny spots, intermediate folder contains images of banana plant leaf(leaves) which contains wide spots upto centimeters of black sigatoka disease and in last intermediate folder contains images of banana plant leaf(leaves) in which leaf is upto 90% affected by black sigatoka disease.

The dataset for banana black sigatoka is collected from local farms as well as some little percentage from internet.

Goal: Banana black sigatoka disease development stage classification using convolutional neural network CNN.

Code Dependency: Tensorflow, Anaconda, Python, jupyter notebook.

All the images are of same dimension 250X250.

Data Augmentation is aleady performed on dataset i.e rotate, shift, shear etc.
